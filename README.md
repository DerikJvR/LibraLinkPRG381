# Java Project - Programming 37(8)1

## Overview
This project involves developing a **Web Application** for user login and registration using JSP/Servlets with PostgreSQL, and a **Desktop Application** for Library Management using **Java Swing** and **JavaDB**. The project demonstrates the understanding and application of **Core Java**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)**, and **CRUD** operations on a database.

## Milestone 1: Web Application - Registration and Login System
A web-based login and registration system using JSP/Servlets with a PostgreSQL database for storing user credentials. 

### Features
- **Registration Page**: Allows new users to register with details like username, password, email, and phone number.
- **Login Page**: Authenticates existing users by checking their credentials against the database.
- **Session Management**: Displays a welcome message for logged-in users and provides a logout option.
  
### Technologies Used
- **Java Server Pages (JSP)**
- **Servlets**
- **PostgreSQL Database**
- **Apache Tomcat/GlassFish Server**

## Milestone 2: Desktop Application - Library Management System
A desktop-based Library Management System created using **Java Swing** with CRUD operations to manage books, borrowers, and loans, stored in a **JavaDB** database.

### Features
- **Books Management**: Add, view, update, and delete book records.
- **Borrowers Management**: Add, view, update, and delete borrower records.
- **GUI**: A user-friendly interface developed using **NetBeans GUI Builder**.
  
### Technologies Used
- **Java Swing** for the desktop GUI.
- **JavaDB** for the database backend.
- **Core Java** with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Project Requirements
1. **Core Java & OOP Concepts**: Implement proper use of collections, exception handling, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
2. **Web Application**: Implement user registration and login with server-side validation using PostgreSQL.
3. **Desktop Application**: CRUD operations on books and borrowers with a user-friendly GUI using **Swing**.
